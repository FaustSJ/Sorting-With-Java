A number of disciplines use distance geometry methods.  In statistics
and psychology, multidimensional scaling has been studied as a way to
visualize data using only similarity or dissimilarity
information~\cite{Borg2005}.  There has been renewed interest in
distance geometry through semidefinite programming due to its
applications to wireless sensor location~\cite{Carter2005} and to
graph embedding~\cite{Shaw2009}.

In structural biology, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)
can generate distance-based information about molecules in solution,
particularly proteins.  Converting this distance information into atom
coordinates allows the structure of the protein to be
ascertained~\cite{Wuthrich1990}\cite{Crippen1988}.  Recently SDP methods
have been applied to resolve coordinates based on incomplete distance
information \cite{Biswas2008}.  Using all atoms in a protein leads to
very large SDPs, thus the approach in \cite{Biswas2008} uses a series
of smaller problems on limited subsets of all atoms and then employs a
stitching procedure to combine the results.  We are interested in
preserving some of the global energy properties of proteins so we
adopt a reduced model of the protein to keep the SDP tractable.
